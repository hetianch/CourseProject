# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data Course Project  

This is the course project for Getting and Cleaning Data on Coursera. The script `run_analysis.R`
is can read in the Samsung data and produce a tab seperated tidy data set `tidy.txt` by the following steps:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.   
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set  
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.   
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.  

### To run `run_analysis.R`:

1. Place sansung data in your working directory.
2. Run through command line: `Rscript run_analysis.R`.
